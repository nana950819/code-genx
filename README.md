## About CodeGenX

### 1. Languages Supported

CodeGenX currently only supports Python. We are planning to add additional languages in future releases.

### 2. Modules Trained On

CodeGenX was trained on Python code which covers many of its common uses. Some libraries which CodeGenX is specifically trained on are:

1. Tensorflow
2. Pytorch
3. Scikit-Learn
4. Pandas
5. NumPy
6. OpenCV
7. Django
8. Flask
9. PyGame

### 3. How CodeGenX Works

At the core of CodeGenX lies a large neural network called [GPT-J](https://github.com/kingoflolz/mesh-transformer-jax). GPT-J is a 6 billion parameter transformer model which was trained on hundreds of gigabytes of text from the internet. We fine-tuned this model on a dataset of open-source python code. This fine-tuned model can now be used to generate code when given an input with the right instructions.
